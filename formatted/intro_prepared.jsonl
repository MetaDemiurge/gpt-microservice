{"prompt":"","completion":" Doctor Manhattan's bio,Doctor Manhattan (real name Jonathan 'Jon' Osterman) was a nuclear physicist transformed into a godlike being by a radioactive particle test. Cold, distant, and easily distracted, he was instrumental in Ozymandias' prevention of nuclear war, and altered the timeline of Prime Earth as part of his experiments.,Quote from Doctor Manhattan: Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing. And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter... Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill such a specific form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold... that is the crowning of unlikelihood. The thermodynamic miracle.,Early Years,Jonathan Osterman was born in 1929 Germany to Jewish watchmaker Josef Osterman and his wife Inge. When Jon was nine years old, Hitler's men began weeding out Jews, chasing his parents out of the country. On the way out, however, Jon witnessed his mother being shot. As a child in America, he planned to follow in his father's footsteps and practiced diligently on one of his father's watches. He was sixteen when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Confronted with the undeniable facts of the theory of relativity, Josef declared his profession outdated and threw the parts of the watch that Jon was working on out the window. He urged his son to instead pursue a career studying nuclear physics.,Osterman attended Princeton University from 1948 to 1958 and graduated with a Ph.D. in atomic physics. In early 1959, he moved to a research base at Gila Flats, where experiments were being performed concerning the 'intrinsic fields' of physical objects which, if tampered with, resulted in their disintegration. There he met Janey Slater, a fellow researcher, and they eventually became lovers.,Manhattan Project,In August 1959, shortly after his thirtieth birthday, Jon planned to give Janey her repaired watch, only to discover he had left it in his lab coat. He remembered that he had left the coat inside the test chamber where they conducted the intrinsic field experiments. While he was inside the chamber retrieving it, the door closed, automatically locking as a safety feature. Unable to open the door or override the countdown, his colleagues—save for Janey, who could not bear to see his last moments—could only watch in horror as Jon had his 'intrinsic field' removed. Bathed in the radiant light, he was torn to pieces by the force of the generator. Instantly he was vaporized and was officially declared dead.,Over the following months, Jon's consciousness began to progressively attempt to retake material form. This progression took the form of partial bodily reappearances, first as a disembodied nervous system, including the brain and eyes, then as a circulatory system, and later as a partially muscled skeleton. Each time the appearance only lasted for a few seconds. Finally, he fully reappeared on November 22 as a tall, hairless, naked, blue-skinned man.,After his transformation, Jon began to experience time in a non-linear, 'quantum' fashion and was aware of and experiencing all the moments of his life simultaneously. He was not omniscient, as he remained reliant on his intellect and sensory experiences to reach conclusions, but his range of sensory data had been abruptly extended. This was in proportion to a lessening of his emotional capacities. This often led him to arrive at conclusions greatly different from those available to normal humans. He had increasing difficulty acting in, what those around him considered, the present moment, leading to many accusations and even the public perception that he was emotionless and uninterested in human affairs. He did nothing to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy, even though he was aware it was going to happen when he met the president. His lack of sentiment was more a matter of radically altered priorities, owing to a colossal, unbridgeable gap of perception between him and the rest of humanity.,He gradually became a pawn of the United States government. He was given the code name 'Doctor Manhattan', a reference to the Manhattan Project, the wartime research project that had developed the atomic bomb. He begrudgingly accepted the costume, a one-piece bodysuit and skullcap, that they provided. But he refused to use the symbol they put on the skullcap as his emblem, instead choosing a representation of a hydrogen atom. Discarding the headpiece and etching the mark on his forehead, he declared that the simplicity of an atomic nucleus with a single electron in orbit was something that kindled his respect. As the years passed, he slowly reduced the size of the bodysuit until, by the end of the 1970s, he refused to wear anything at all, except for mandatory public appearances.,However, his presence still succeeded in tipping the balance of the Cold War in the West's favor, and the United States consequently became more aggressive and adventurous. His abilities also radically altered the world economy, as he could, for example, synthesize the massive amounts of lithium required for all motor vehicles to become electric. At the request of President Richard Nixon, he brought America victory in the Vietnam War within three months. This victory distorted the American political process, as the 22nd Amendment was repealed and Nixon was repeatedly re-elected.,Crimebusters,During the first meeting of the Crimebusters, Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre, caught his eye. His relationship with Janey Slater ended acrimoniously shortly thereafter, and he then began dating Laurie.,During the execution of Adrian Veidt's plot to save the world, Jon was accused of having given cancer to those who were exposed to him over long periods of time. It emerged that this was untrue and that it was actually a careful fabrication of Veidt's to cause Doctor Manhattan to exile himself to Mars. Eventually, he brought Laurie there, where they argued over the fate of the human race.,As they traveled above Mars in his floating glass fortress, he explained his belief that life was an overrated phenomenon, citing the barren planet as an example of natural, undisturbed beauty. Laurie tried to convince him otherwise, but he was not persuaded. Angered at his indifference to Earth's well-being, she demanded he send her home to die with the others. He told her that, while she always asks him to see things through the human viewpoint, she had never attempted to see things through his eyes. While attempting this as he allowed her to perceive her entire life all at one time, she realized her father was Edward Blake.,As she wept over this epiphany, Jon explained that he had spent his time trying to define what could be considered a miracle, but neglected to see anything of the sort in human coupling. The odds against two people like her mother and the Comedian coming together to create a child like her, he believed, was the same as turning air into gold. With this revelation, his interest in humanity was restored and he returned them to Earth to stop Veidt's plan.,They arrived too late, however, as Manhattan had already been destroyed by the psychic shock-wave from the 'squid monster' that Veidt teleported to the city. His perception of the future was being blocked by tachyon particles, but he was able to locate the source, Veidt's Antarctic lair. Teleporting there, he began to feel more distorted as he drew closer to the tachyon generators' source. He confronted Veidt, who tried to run from him. Stalling him with Bubastis, Veidt threw the switch on an intrinsic field disrupter, blowing both his pet and Jon apart.,Veidt's victory seemed certain, but Jon materialized outside as a giant, asking Veidt if he actually expected something that could not kill Jon Osterman could kill Doctor Manhattan. Before he could kill Veidt, however, Veidt turned on his wall of televisions in order to show Jon that all the countries in the world, including the United States and Soviet Union, had ceased conflict. They were doing this in order to try and understand the 'alien attack' on New York. Seeing that his plan had brought about genuine world peace, Jon agreed with the others, aside from Rorschach, that going public with Veidt's plan was counterproductive.,Jon confronted the defiant Rorschach, warning him that he could not let him reveal the truth. In tears, Rorschach removed his mask, screaming at Jon to do what must be done. He obliged by killing Rorschach. Returning to Karnak, he saw Dan Dreiberg and Laurie together, happy that they had found each other. He appeared before Veidt, informing him that he was leaving for another galaxy. In reality, Jon decided to broaden his range of exploration and travel to a completely different universe.,Rebirth,As part of the Great Darkness' attempts to deal with what it considered its real enemy - the superheroes of Earth 0 - it cursed Jon with the task of stealing time from the Prime Universe to weaken them. The end result caused the residents of Earth 0 to become ten years younger and to lose much of their past. Over time, Jon continued to observe and experiment with this universe.,He rescued Jor-El from the destruction of Krypton, setting him up with the identity of Mister Oz to watch his son's life on Earth. Jon's intent was for Jor-El to reconsider his decision to send Kal-El to Earth.,After Owlman escaped with the Mobius Chair to the Moon, he and Metron used its power to learn the secrets of the universe, only to be incinerated by Manhattan after discovering his meddling with the timeline. Jon then imbued the Mobius Chair with a portion of his power.,The Button,When the Comedian's button appeared in the Batcave after Wally West returned to the timeline, Reverse-Flash attacked Batman in the cave and took the button. Using it as a beacon, the Reverse-Flash set out through the timestream to find its owner. After finally tracing it to a location, he sensed Jon's power upon arrival, demanding him to reveal himself. Jon then did so, frightening Reverse-Flash to the point of begging for his life. Jon then partially incinerated Thawne and transported him back to the Batcave with half his body reduced to burnt muscle and bone. Just before dying, Thawne exclaimed that he saw 'God'. Jon then retrieved the button from the ground where it had fallen.,Doomsday Clock,Within years after Jon's departure from his world, it had become pure chaos. Veidt became desperate and attempted to find Jon, believing only he could bring order back to the world. To this end, Veidt used quantum tunneling to follow Jon into the Flash's universe.[7] After arriving, he discovered that Jon had teleported Eddie Blake to this universe just before he had died at Veidt's hand in their home reality.[8] Jon is summoned by Veidt. He reveals the reason he spared Mime and Marionette was because their second child does something to impress him. He also reveals Veidt was lying about having cancer, before leaving for Mars. It is then revealed the reason he came to Prime Earth is because he saw an enraged Superman punch him and saw nothing happen afterwards. He believes Superman kills him or he destroys everything.,The energy that caused Firestorm's explosion in Moscow matched that of Dr. Manhattan which the Justice League traced to Mars. When multiple heroes from Earth, along with Firestorm arrive, he has Martian Manhunter broadcast his vision of the future where he destroys Superman or is destroyed himself. The heroes attack him but he doesn't see them as a threat, instead inquiring about the unusual properties of their universe such as the Lanterns' rings and magic. To undermine Firestorm, Jon shows Ronnie that Professor Stein meaningfully fused them together in that explosion. Captain Atom attempts to destroy Jon by unleashing his full power, but Jon rebuilds himself and completely knocks out every hero.,It was later revealed that Jon had been on Earth Prime far longer than anyone suspected. He watched as the world seemingly adjusted, changing everything around him and all of it seemingly centered around Superman. Out of curiosity, Jon messed with history, preventing Alan Scott from obtaining his Green Lantern Battery and allowing him to die. This created a timeline where superheroes came to existence much later, as the Justice Society of America never existed, and turned Superman into a more alien figure. However, he became haunted by visions of his fated encounter with Superman.,As Superman went to confront Black Adam and his entourage at the White House, Jon waited for Superman to arrive, watching as Superman crashed in front of him. Veidt reveals to Saturn Girl that Jon had revealed to him the real reason he didn't kill Mime and Marionette - because he knew that their son will grow up to be bring joy to a woman who was very important to him in the past. This was the reason Veidt had the two broken out of prison again. He realized that Jon had come to their universe to be with those similar to him: the super-heroes of whom there were many in this universe. He asked Jon for help but he refused as he thought either Superman will destroy him or he will destroy the universe. As a result, Veidt made a new plan to save both universes by making sure the League was incapicated and Jon would confront Superman alone.,Osterman warned Superman that either he will destroy him or he will destroy everything. The potential showdown however was interrupted by a fight between metahumans from various countries. Meanwhile, Superman's wife, Lois Lane, was shown, by Lex Luthor, the exact same picture of Dr. Manhattan with Janey Slater that had been left throughout various time periods, telling her to expose it to the world that someone had altered their timeline in the past. Meanwhile, when Superman questions Jon why he isn't helping, he states he's seen the future where he won't. Questioned again, he reveals how his own world was destroyed after an opportunity at peace.,Jon reveals to Superman that he altered the past, causing his parents to die and erasing people he once knew merely out of curiosity. He then tells him to make a choice between destroying him or being destroyed, telling him that he can't see the future beyond it. Superman however chooses to protect him from Pozhar's attack. When questioned by him, Clark responds that there is a third choice. Seeing so many pictures of him and Janey he had created, Clark realizes she must have been important to him.,Superman then tells Jon that maybe he can't see the future because he might have to give everything up to save his world and he can choose it. Inspired by his words, Jon decides to undo his alterations by moving the Green Lantern back into Alan Scott's reach. This restored the JSA, the JSA in turn inspires a young Clark to become Superboy, which also inspired the Legion of Super-Heroes and ensured the survival of his parents. Jon also finds that every time the metaverse is altered, the Multiverse is expanded to preserve every world where Superman lived. He also sees the future and the forthcoming crisises as well as alterations to the timeline, realizing in the end that Superman will always guide mankind. Manhattan then summons Veidt, the Comedian, Mime and Marionette to himself. He leaves Mime and Marionette on Prime Earth, assuring they'll see their son again before leaving for 1954 where he encourages Carver Colman to come out as gay.,Jon's actions resulted in the JSA and Legion of Super-Heroes coming to Superman's rescue while also stopping the metahuman battle. Lois meanwhile is able to expose the truth of Firestorm's explosion because of Veidt. He then travels back to his world, to 1992, where Veidt's plan had been exposed and had led to a nuclear holocaust. He then travels back in time to stop the missiles, making all nuclear weapons on Earth disappear before taking away Mime and Marionette's son, realizing that he himself was the reason why he couldn't figure out the child's future completely. He raises him as his own and names him 'Clark' in honor of Superman. Who showed him what it means to be a true hero.,After Clark grows up into a young kid, Jon shifts his consciousness to look to a timeline where Janey convinced him to continue enjoying lunch and not bother to retrieve her watch. As a result, he is never transformed and he and Janey marry six months later and start a family. Smiling, Jon remarks it was a nice daydream to exist in. He tells Clark to find Daniel and Laurie Dreiberg, the former Nite Owl and Silk Spectre respectively, so he would be loved and will give it back. Now that Superman had inspired him, he regretted that he couldn't be the hero people needed, transferring what remains of his powers to Clark so he would become a true hero for their Earth before he himself ceased to exist.,*END*"}
